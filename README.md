**...provides a measurement tool set for wireless research with Atheros WiFi hardware**

### RegMon - in-Kernel MAC-Layer Monitoring
To perform the monitoring, we leverage the lightweight kernel-to-userspace debug file system (debugfs)
This serves two purposes:

1. it enables a a simple file-based configuration of RegMon for its in-kernel operations from the userspace
2. the actual trace-file from the kernel can be accessed via standard file read (e.g., with tail, cat) from the userspace.

For the actual measurements, it is possible to access Atheros control and status registers stored in the card memory through the PCI bus. Each of the Linux drivers (i.e., Madwifi, ath5k and ath9k) has its own C functions or macros to access the memory-mapped 32-bit register content, as shown at the bottom of the RegMon picture.

RegMon is implemented as a single kernel driver patch  for each of the supported three drivers, without the need for additional modules, daemons or user-space applications.
All main functions of RegMon and their interactions are:

The trace-file generated by RegMon is currently formatted as space separated list of measurement values, which turned out to be a sufficient format to parse and process the trace file for further analysis.

### How to install RegMon (under Linux OpenWrt)

1. copy RegMon patches (ath5k and/or ath9k) into openwrt/package/kernel/mac80211/patches 
2. re-build mac80211 subsystem by: make package/mac80211/{clean,compile} or re-build complite OpenWrt
3. install new mac80211 package or flash full image to your router

### How to use RegMon sampling

- specify you own register reads via: 
```
echo XY-REGISTER-VALUE > /sys/kernel//debug/ieee80211/phy0/regmon/reg7..11
```
- set the sampling interval in nanoseconds (e.g. 50000ns = 20kHz sampling rate)
```
echo 50000 > /sys/kernel//debug/ieee80211/phy0/regmon/sampling_interval
```
- read RegMon data e.g. via:
```
cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/regmon/register_log
```

For availabe Atheros registers take a look at:
```
- ath5k:
  drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/reg.h
- ath9k:
  drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/ath9k/ar5008_initvals.h
  drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/ath9k/ar9001_initvals.h
  drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/ath9k/ar9002_initvals.h
```
- collect RegMon traces, parse, analyze and plot them
(in the script folder there are several unsorted awk, shell, R & python scipts that I wrote & use .. ToDo: clean-up)

### Example of RegMon's logging output
![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1880886/9058435/50d96800-3aa1-11e5-98c9-330c7aa15234.jpg)

### Parse logging output of RegMon to prepare ploting
In order to plot your register values that were collected by RegMon, someone could parse and precalculate certain values of interest.

The provided awk script **parse_default_RegMon-trace.awk** is such an example of preprocessing the output of RegMon for proper plotting. It performs the following operations with RegMon default output:
- calculate the absolute and relative difference of timestamps and register counters for each line sampled
- account for the baseband MAC clock rate at different IEEE 8021.11 modes, e.g:
 - 802.11g 20MHz channel width @2.4GHz -> MAC clock rate = 44MHz
 - 802.11a 20MHz channel width @5GHz   -> MAC clock rate = 40MHz
 - 802.11n 40MHz channel width @2.4GHz -> MAC clock rate = 88MHz
 - 802.11n 40MHz channel width @5GHz   -> MAC clock rate = 80MHz
 - all other MAC clocl rates at different channel width are a multiple of those given above
- change hexadecimal representation into decimal
- add an optional header to the parsed data

You can use it by issuing:
```
cat register_log | gawk --non-decimal-data -v header=1 -c clock=40 -f parse_default_RegMon-trace.awk
```

this leads to the following output:
```
ktime d_ktime d_tsf d_mac d_tx rel_tx d_rx rel_rx d_ed rel_ed d_idle rel_idl d_others rel_others d_read mib_reset

```
where:
- ktime = kernel time stamp
- d_ktime = time difference in nanoseconds from previous kernel time stamp
- d_tsf = time difference in nanoseconds from previous tsf time stamp
- d_mac = absolute mac count difference in ticks from previous sample
- d_tx = absolute tx busy state count difference in ticks from previous sample
- rel_tx = relative tx_busy state count per mac counts in percent
- d_rx = absolute rx busy state count difference in ticks from previous sample
- rel_rx =relative rx_busy state count per mac counts in percent
- d_ed = absolute energy_detection busy state count difference in ticks from previous sample
- rel_ed = relative energy_detection state count per mac counts in percent
- d_idle = absolute idle state count difference in ticks from previous sample
- rel_idle = relative idle state state count per mac counts in percent
- d_others = absolute (energy_detection - rx_busy) state count difference in ticks from previous sample
- rel_others = relative (energy_detection - rx_busy) state count per mac counts in percent
- d_read = time duration it took to read all busdy state registers in nanoseconds
- mib_reset = if a MIB register reset happened, it will show a '1', otherwise a '0'

... and now you can plot your mac busy state distribution over time with e.g. 'R':
